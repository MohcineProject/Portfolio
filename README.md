# Portfolio

This is currently my personal portfolio that I built by following a wonderful tutorial on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV7S8BhIeBo&t=6024s). This was my first real experience in web development, and I learned a lot. I modified the code base since then and I will continue to do so in the future. Currently, the project is a simple static web page, but I am eager to change it to an Angular project in the future.

## How to run 

Simply clone the project locally to a folder of your choice:

```sh
git clone <URI>
```

And open the HTML file `index.html` in a browser of your choice.
